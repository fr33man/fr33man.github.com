{"name":"Fr33man.github.com","tagline":"","body":"This is the homepage of fr33man. I will collect and post information\r\nhere that I find useful in the study and practice of protecting one's\r\nprivacy, identity, freedom, sovereignty, liberty, property, family,\r\nreligion, wealth, and computers.\r\n\r\nIf you have to ask why these things need protecting from then you\r\nprobably don't belong here. Or you see little wrong with the way that\r\nthe USA is being run. On the other hand, if you fit into either of these\r\ncategories then you are just the type of person that needs to be\r\neducated. Please take the time to follow my links and read everything\r\nfound therein. However, this site is intended for those seeking such\r\ninformation and serves as a central repository of links collected over\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIt has taken considerable time locating, reviewing, and studying the\r\ninformation below. I try to organize them by topic. I also regularly\r\ncheck that the material I'm linking to is still live. Please let me know\r\nif you find any broken links.\r\n\r\nPlease email me if you have useful information that's not already on\r\nthis list but you think should be.

This is the homepage of fr33man. I will collect and post information
here that I find useful in the study and practice of protecting one's
privacy, identity, freedom, soverignty, liberty, property, family,
religion, wealth, and computers.

If you have to ask why these things need protecting from then you
probably don't belong here. Or you see little wrong with the way that
the USA is being run. On the other hand, if you fit into either of these
categories then you are just the type of person that needs to be
educated. Please take the time to follow my links and read everything
found therein. However, this site is intended for those seeking such
information and serves as a central repository of links collected over
time.

It has taken considerable time locating, reviewing, and studying the
information below. I try to organize them by topic. I also regularly
check that the material I'm linking to is still live. Please let me know
if you find any broken links.

Please email me if you have useful information that's not already on
this list but you think should be. I'll be happy to include links to any
and all similar content.
